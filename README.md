### An Interesting Article

Recently for my Social Networking class, I read an article about [the Netflix Prize](https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/the-netflix-prize) that I found to be really interesting. I don't even think I remember hearing about this competition growing up, so to learn about an event where a big company held such an exciting and rigorous coding competition was really cool.

What was also interesting to me was that Netflix released such a big quantity of data for developers to work on and developers of all ages and experiences were willing to give it a try. It was also nice to read that the prize money of **_$1 million_** was donated by the winning team. However, after the first competition ended and the comapny wanted to host a sequel, the data that they released was deemed a violation of privacy and there was never another competition quite like it.

It is unfortunate that the comepition ended up being shut down due to privacy reasons. I think it would be interesting if Netflix ended up modifying it slightly in the future to not violate any privacy laws but continue the competition. I think its also amazing that a senior in college ended up winning the tournament.

Interesting how the Netflix Prize was a groundbreaking competition that not only promised a million-dollar jackpot but also catalyzed a global community of data enthusiasts and experts, and ultimately reshaping the landscape of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
